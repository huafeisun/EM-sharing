File descriptions
* *01-KuprenasEtal-W98-modification:* First the sharing file showing the time-dependent ODE and the equilibrium floc sizes under various G and C values.
* *02-KuprenasEtal-Equilibrium-CoefValues.ipynb:* Equilibrium floc sizes using the original calibration coefficients and suggested updates based on condition specific concentrations and temperatures. 
* *03-G_estimates_for_channel_flows.ipynb:* Estimate of depth varying and layer averaged turbulent shear rates under various conditions. Inputs include the layer averaged velocity and the layer depth.
